      "Challenge:\n",
      "You have 12 identical-looking coins. One is counterfeit and differs in weight (it could be heavier or lighter), while the other 11 are genuine and weigh the same. Using only a balance scale and at most 3 weighings, determine exactly which coin is counterfeit and whether it is heavier or lighter. Specify the coins you place on each side for every weighing and how you deduce the answer from the outcomes.\n",

      "Hint:\n",
      "- Think in terms of information: 3 weighings yield 3^3 = 27 possible outcome patterns (left heavier, right heavier, or balance each time), which is just enough to distinguish the 24 possibilities (12 coins × {heavier, lighter}).\n",
      "- Design your weighings so each coin has a unique “signature” across the three weighings, using balanced groups (equal total number and distribution on each side). A good way is to assign each coin a triple of positions across the three weighings: left (+1), right (−1), or off the scale (0), making sure each weighing has equal total “+1” and “−1.” The direction the scale tips then tells you both which coin it is and whether it’s heavier or lighter (the sign flips for lighter).\n"

      "Business area: Retail deductions and chargeback dispute automation for CPG suppliers\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this is a strong Agentic AI opportunity\n",
      "- Pain is acute and measurable: Retailer deductions (shortages, compliance, pricing, freight) can be 2–8% of revenue. Recovery requires multi-step, cross-system work. ROI is directly tied to recovered dollars and cycle time.\n",
      "- Agentic fit: The workflow is long-running, tool-heavy, and asynchronous (portals, emails, EDI, carriers). An autonomous agent can gather evidence, reason about policies, assemble packets, submit disputes, and follow up.\n",
      "- Underserved by current tools: Existing products focus on analytics, RPA, or portals for manual work. Few deliver end-to-end autonomous dispute handling with human-in-the-loop guardrails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core agent workflows\n",
      "- Intake and triage\n",
      "  - Ingest EDI 812/832/852 deduction data, retailer portal alerts, and ERP A/R transactions.\n",
      "  - Classify reason code (shortage, ASN mismatch, labeling, pricing, freight) and estimate recoverability based on retailer-specific rules.\n",
      "- Evidence gathering\n",
      "  - Pull matching documents: PO (850), Invoice (810), ASN (856), carrier POD/BOL, WMS pick/pack, QC photos, routing guides, compliance certifications.\n",
      "  - Cross-check quantities, dates, SCAC, NMFC, and carton-level detail; detect common errors (split shipments, late ASN, label scans).\n",
      "- Dispute assembly and submission\n",
      "  - Draft retailer-specific dispute packets with citations to policies and annotated exhibits.\n",
      "  - File in retailer portals (Retail Link, Partners Online, VendorNet, etc.) or via email per SOP; create and track case IDs.\n",
      "- Follow-up and escalation\n",
      "  - Calendar SLAs, nudge when no response, escalate with additional evidence or manager contacts; maintain a communication log.\n",
      "- Resolution and prevention\n",
      "  - Post outcomes to ERP, reconcile A/R, and auto-create recovery/write-off journal entries.\n",
      "  - Root-cause analytics and playbooks to reduce future deductions (e.g., ASN timing fix, carton label SOP, carrier selection).\n",
      "\n",
      "Key integrations\n",
      "- ERP/financials: NetSuite, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, Sage (A/R, invoices, deductions).\n",
      "- EDI/TMS/WMS: SPS Commerce/TrueCommerce, ShipStation, Manhattan/Blue Yonder; carrier APIs (UPS/FedEx/USPS/major 3PLs).\n",
      "- Retailer portals: Walmart Retail Link, Target Partners Online, Amazon Vendor Central, Costco, Kroger, etc. (mix of APIs and headless browser automation).\n",
      "- Document stores and email: Google/Microsoft 365, Box/SharePoint.\n",
      "- Policy knowledge: Retailer routing guides and deduction policies ingested into a RAG index.\n",
      "\n",
      "MVP scope (90 days)\n",
      "- ICP: Mid-market CPG brands ($50M–$500M revenue) selling to 3–5 big-box retailers; 1–5 FTEs currently working deductions.\n",
      "- Start with shortages and pricing disputes for 2 retailers (e.g., Walmart, Target).\n",
      "- Capabilities: End-to-end packet prep, portal submission, SLA tracking, ERP sync, human-in-the-loop approvals before submission.\n",
      "- Guardrails: Deterministic checks on quantities/dates, full audit trail, configurable confidence thresholds for auto-submit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Success metrics\n",
      "- Dollars recovered per month and recovery rate uplift vs. baseline.\n",
      "- Cycle time from deduction receipt to submission; days sales outstanding impact.\n",
      "- Analyst time saved (hours per $1,000 disputed).\n",
      "- Reduction in repeat deductions by root cause category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go-to-market\n",
      "- Pricing: Platform fee + success-based fee (e.g., 10–20% of recovered dollars) to align incentives.\n",
      "- Land with a 60-day pilot on 1–2 retailers; guarantee or target 30–50% recovery rate improvement and 50–70% cycle time reduction.\n",
      "- Champions: A/R managers, Deduction/Chargeback teams, VP Finance/Controller, Ops leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differentiation\n",
      "- Agentic, not just analytics: Automatically gathers evidence, reasons over retailer-specific rules, and takes action across portals.\n",
      "- Retailer-specific SOP library and policy-aware RAG for precise citations.\n",
      "- Human-in-the-loop workflow with auditable decisions; learns from outcomes to improve recovery predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risks and mitigations\n",
      "- Portal terms/compliance: Prefer official APIs; where unavailable, use consented automation with retailer-approved methods; maintain allowlists and rate limits.\n",
      "- Hallucinations/accuracy: Combine LLM reasoning with deterministic validations and document ground-truth checks; require approval for low-confidence cases.\n",
      "- Security: SOC 2, least-privilege integrations, tokenized credentials, PII minimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example “day in the life”\n",
      "- Receives Walmart deduction (code 22 shortage) for PO 123456.\n",
      "- Agent pulls ASN 856, carrier POD, WMS pick list; detects split shipment delivered in two trailers, both on time; identifies DC scan gap on second trailer.\n",
      "- Generates packet with side-by-side quantity reconciliation, POD timestamps, and policy citations; submits in Retail Link, tracks case ID, follows up at 7 days.\n",
      "- On approval, posts recovery to ERP and flags recurring “split shipment scan gap” root cause with a recommended ASN timing change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why now\n",
      "- Retail compliance complexity is increasing; APIs and integrations are more available; LLMs plus tool-use make true end-to-end automation feasible.\n",
      "- Clear ROI, visible to finance leaders, enables fast purchase decisions.\n"

       "- Share 3–5 recent shortage deductions with ASNs, WMS extracts, and carrier data to run a backtest and produce a gap analysis.\n",
       "- Provide list of target retailers and policy documents for initial rule extraction.\n",
       "- Align on SSO, credential vault, and data residency requirements.\n",
       "- Stand up a 6–8 week pilot focused on split shipments and ASN timing anomalies with clear success metrics."
